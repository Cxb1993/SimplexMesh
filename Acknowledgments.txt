This code was initially developed primarily by Christopher Batty during a postdoc under Eitan Grinspun in Columbia University's Computer Graphics Group (C2G2), supported by a Banting Postdoctoral Fellowship. The C2G2 lab itself is supported in part by the Sloan Foundation, the NSF (grants CMMI-11-29917, IIS-11-17257, IIS-10-48948, IIS-09-16129, CCF-06-43268), and generous gifts from Adobe, Autodesk, Intel, mental images, NVIDIA, Side Effects Software, and The Walt Disney Company.

Thanks are also due to other members of the lab for helpful discussions and suggestions, including Andres Uribe, Fang Da, Danny Kaufman, and Breannan Smith.
